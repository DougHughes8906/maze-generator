Program used to generate mazes. As currently designed, the program 
prints out mazes to the terminal with walls represented by 'X's and
path area represented by blank spaces. There are three options for both
the sizing and the difficulty of the maze.

To build the program, enter 'make createMaze' in the command line.

The executable file will be named 'createMaze'.
